                    <p>EDGI (Environmental Data Governance Initiative) is an action-oriented collaborative watchdog that aims to identify the ways the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) neglects various communities throughout the United States.</p>
                    <h3>Goal</h3>
                <p>Create an interactive map web app to display county-based Environmental Protection Act violation data for educators, students, journalists, and informed members of the public to easily digest.</p>

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The EPA is supposed to perform routine checks on facilities throughout the US and penalize those who fail to meet environmental standards. However, many industries tend to commit more environmental violations than others. EDGI analyzes data from facilities in these industries to understand the extent of EPA violations.</p>
            <p>They do this by generating PDF “report cards” to depict environmental violations by US Congressional District. <strong>However</strong>, the data used is from outdated 2010 census data, displayed on PDFs that are <strong>difficult to understand</strong>, <strong>difficult to access</strong>, and <strong>difficult to navigate</strong>.</p>

            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>EDGI seeks to facilitate greater understanding and learning of environmental issues for educators, students, journalists, and informed members of the public by replacing their PDF report cards with an <strong>interactive</strong>, <strong>user-friendly data visualization platform displaying U.S. county-specific data</strong>.</p>
            <p>Our goals were to implement the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An interactive map with clickable and searchable states / counties, along with facility markers</li>
                <li>A user guide that can be closed and reopened</li>
                <li>Clicking a county displays county-specific data figures and associated explanations</li>
                <li>An additional information section with an anchor scroll navigation</li>

            <hr>
            <p>Both myself and my partner designer had never designed an interactive map before, so identifying strengths and weaknesses in competitors was valuable to our design process.</p>
            <p>We examined two data visualization web apps with interactive maps: Environmental Working Group and California Environmental Protection Agency.</p>

                <li>Clickable circles denote facilities and clusters of facilities</li>

            <h2>Brainstorming and Sketches</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>With our user and market insights in mind, we developed the information architecture.</p>
            <p>While we organized the information in similar fashion to the current PDF report cards, notable changes are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The client notified us they wanted to prioritize the information under the sections: Grading, Highlights, District in Comparison, Recent Non-Compliance, and the additional information at the bottom of the PDF</li>
                <li>We decided to implement a user guide to address the issues we discovered in our user interviews of user confusion when navigating data platforms and digesting data</li>
                <li>The data reliability note was not present in all data sections of the PDF, but applied to all of the figures in the PDF, so we included it in all data-related groups in our architecture</li>
            </ul>

            </figure>
            <p>With this roadmap, we were able to begin exploring the general map display and interface:</p>

            <h2>Medium Fidelity Designs</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>With a clearer picture of what we were looking to design, we spent a few weeks iterating in mid-fidelity designs:</p>
            <h3>Side Panel Explorations</h3>
            <p class="greenitalic">How might we display each data section's contents?</p>
            <figure>
                <img id="sidepanel" src="images/sidepanel.png" alt="Medium fidelity side panel display explorations">
                <figcaption>Mid fidelity explorations of side panel display</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>There were many moving pieces in our side panel iterations, from collapsibility to the number of side panels. We concluded that we would proceed with <strong>Option 2</strong>, a single panel which a user would navigate between data sections via a tab navigation, because it was simple, intuitive, and clean.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="highfidelity">
            <h2>High Fidelity Designs</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Grading Tab</h3>
            <p class="greenitalic">How might we display a navigation bar inside of another navigation bar?</p>
            <p>We knew we wanted to group the information within the Grading section by legislative act (CAA, CWA, and RCRA), but found the double-horizontal navigation bars to be visually unappealing. We explored different displays of this nested navigation:</p>
            <figure>
                <img id="gradingexplorations" src="images/gradingact.png" alt="Explorations of the grading act display">
                <figcaption>High fidelity grading act navigation iterations</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We decided to proceed with <strong>Option 4</strong> because we preferred the vertical orientation of the navigation and the offshoot line to denote that the information to the right belonged to the act highlighted.</p>
            <h3>Graph Transparency and Colors</h3>
            <p class="greenitalic">How might we indicate data reliability in our data figures?</p>
            <p>Although data on all three acts (CAA, CWA, RCRA) exists, not all of the data is equally reliable. As noted in the side panels, the reliability of the data varies; for example, CWA data tends to be the most reliable. Following and improving upon the PDF report cards, we changed the colors for the visualizations comparing the county to the state and nation––this would enhance the color accessibility and better highlight differences in reliability:</p>
            <figure>
                <img id="transparency" src="images/transparency.png" alt="Comparing the original PDF display of the 'in comparison' figures and our new 'in comparison' figure design">
                <figcaption>Comparison of original PDF in comparison figures (left) to our new comparison figure design (right)</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="greenitalic">How might we clarify the Noncompliance sidebar figure color indications?</p>
            <p>One of our user interviewees mentioned confusion regarding the significance of having several different colors on the Noncompliance graphs. After sharing this with our clients, they suggested using shades to reflect intensity of violation, so we chose a single color and adjusted the shades accordingly:</p>
            <figure>
                <img id="color" src="images/color.png" alt="Comparing the original PDF display of the 'recent noncompliance' figures and our new 'recent noncompliance' figure design">
                <figcaption>Comparison of original PDF recent noncompliance figure (left) to our new noncompliance figure design (right)</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h3>Making Space for the Map</h3>
            <p class="greenitalic">How might we provide users greater control over their map view?</p>
            <p>Some of our developers mentioned that it would be helpful for users to have the ability to view the map in full screen to navigate around. While this was not explicitly brought up in user interviews, we agreed that it was a useful feature to include that was not difficult to implement for the developers. We explored designs for a collapse / expand button:</p>
            <figure>
                <img id="collapse" src="images/collapse.png" alt="High fidelity explorations for sidebar interactivity">
                <figcaption>High fidelity explorations for sidebar interactivity</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We ended up choosing <strong>Option 3</strong>; the placement of the collapse icon in Options 1 and 2 were a bit awkward, and we were unsure where an expand button would go after collapsing the panel. With Option 3, however, the button at the side of the panel would remain visible whether the panel is hidden or shown.</p>
            <h3>Adding Additional Information</h3>
            <p class="greenitalic">How might we differentiate the additional information anchor navigation to avoid confusion?</p>
            <p>The additional information contains all of the indexes, tables, and background on the county data reports project. The PDF version of these sections is very difficult to read and navigate, so we decided to implement an anchor navigation that would scroll to a section upon a user's click, as well as a more effective heading and subheading system.</p>
            <figure>
                <img id="additionalinfo" src="images/additionalinfo.png" alt="High fidelity anchor navigation explorations">
                <figcaption>High fidelity anchor navigation explorations</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>At first, we were using EDGI's current design for their navigation between pages (Option 1), but we realized that would be confusing for the user, because the navigation we are implementing above has a different function (scrolling to a section on the same page). We went with <strong>Option 2</strong> instead.</p>

            <p>We finalized our prototype in Figma, shown in the video above. Here are five user flows we prototyped:</p>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Searching for a state
                    <ul>
                        <li>User searches for a state (can either click the matched result or the search icon)</li>

                        <li>Can click into a county from state view</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Searching for a county
                    <ul>
                        <li>User searches for a county (can either click the matched result or the search icon)</li>
                        <li>Sends user to county view</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note">Note: We would have liked to demonstrate that the map would zoom into a state or county when clicked or searched for, but we could not do that in Figma. Additionally, if the cluster of facilities is clicked, it would zoom the map in further to those specific facilities.</p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>This was my first design project, both on Hack4Impact and personally. This was also a 0 to 100 project, so I was able to experience all of the stages of the design process. I am so thankful for this incredible and fulfilling opportunity; I have learned an immense amount from my work on this project. While it is difficult to summarize my growth in a few points, here are some key takeaways I acquired from my work on this project:</p>
            <ul id="reflections-list">
                <li>⭐️ <strong>Working with another designer</strong>
                    <p>This was my first collaborative project; I had no experience working with another designer before. We often had different designs in mind for the web app, whether it be about the additional information navigation bar or the grading tab display. Being in a designer duo on this project taught me the importance of <strong>considering other perspectives and ideas</strong>. Very often, the product of multiple minds is greater than the sum of those minds’ individual products.</p>
                </li>
                <li>⭐️ <strong>Being mindful of developer feasibility</strong>
                    <p>As this project was entirely contributed to by university students, there are certain features we initially designed that are not feasible to implement developer-wise. With this also being my first project working with developers, I learned to <strong>balance advocating for the user and keeping feasibility in mind</strong>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>⭐️ <strong>Prioritizing certain features</strong>
                    <p>There were many features we wanted to implement that we simply did not have time for, such as an ability to download SVGs of the figures, since that was a key insight in our user interviews with journalists. However, because all of our team were also full-time students and many were newly inducted to the Hack4Impact project team, including myself, we had to <strong>prioritize certain features over others</strong>.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>I would like to end by thanking my team: my PM, TL, design partner, and developers. Thanks to them and their tireless contributions, our web app will make EPA violation data and awareness of EPA violations more accessible to all.</p>
